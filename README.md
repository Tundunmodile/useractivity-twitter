# useractivity-twitter

## Project Description

**Twitter User Activity**
is an application that sources data from twitter using Twitter's API.
The obtained data is used to gain insights on popular activity times among users.
Due to max limit on tweets per call, I make several calls to the API to get tweets for different time slots/ hourly sessions.
Afterwhich I put the tweets into a CSV file and then read from it into the dataframe to begin cleanup and analysis

## Technical Instructions
- Requires API credentials
- Requires Jupyter Notebook to run application
- Packages to install include: dotenv, pandas, mathplotlib, seaborn, numpy

## Project Requirements

**Category 1: Python Progamming Basics**
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

**Category 2: Utilize External Data**
- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app

**Category 3: Data Display**
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
- Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis 
- Use Plotly or Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data
